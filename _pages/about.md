## TLDR
I am zoomiti and this is my webpage. I post my findings whenever I get stuck on
a problem and need to research a solution. The internet has always been there
for me so I figure I should be there for it.

## Introduction
Hey everyone! I go by zoomiti in most of my online presences.

I am an Embedded Firmware/Software Engineer currently going into my Senior year
of University at Northeastern University. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors
of Science in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

Although my main trade is in Embedded Engineering, occasionally I pursue other
fields for personal projects for the fun of it. I am a firm believer in Open
Source software so you can find most of these projects in my
[GitHub](https://github.com/zoomiti).

## Major Projects

### EvolvingBehavior
The project I am most proud of is a research project I contributed to known as
[EvolvingBehavior](https://gitlab.com/NPC-Dev/evolvingbehavior). It is an
Unreal Engine Plugin that allows developers to use evolutionary genetic algorithms
to produce behavior trees for NPC artificial intelligence.

## Purpose
This site is mainly to document the rare times I get stuck on a project and could
not find a readily available answer online. When I find/research/discover the
solution I'll write a blog post about it here.
